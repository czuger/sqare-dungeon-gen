d=Dungeon.new( dungeon_size )

# Exemple :

# This will not create a dungeon of 4 rooms size, but a dungeon of 4**2*0.3 rooms (rounded up)
# The dungeon constructor accept another parameter wich is the amount of rooms to remove from the dungeon
# This parameter is a number between 0 and 1. By default it is set to 0.3 which mean that it will remove 30% of the rooms.

d=Dungeon.new( 4, 0.5 )
# Will remove 50% of the rooms

# Draw your dungeon
d.draw( 'out/dungeon.jpg' )
# Or only the curren room
d.draw_current_room( 'out/current_room.jpg' )

# You can get the directions available from the current room
d.available_directions
#Â => [ :left, :right ] # according to your dungeon which is random

# Then you can move the current room by moving in a direction
d.set_next_room( :left )
# Will move the current_room to the left.
```
